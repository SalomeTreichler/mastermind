# VISION

The purpose is that we want to implement something as a product, that we will have fun with upon its completion. Something that we will actually enjoy. 
We want to accomplish a better version of a product, that we've already implemented in a prior module.
For our customers who want to find a new way of enjoying Mastermind. Mastermind is an online game that is completely free and unlike any other version of the game. Our product will blow your (Master)mind.

### Target Group ###

The market segment we are targeting, is the online games community. 
The product targets anyone who enjoys old fashioned games reinvented with a modern twist. 

### Needs ###

We are solving the lack of good Mastermind games available online for free!
The benefits of being able to play Mastermind online are many. One of which is, being able to conveniently start a game at any point in life, without having to buy a board game for this exact purpose. 

### Product ###

Our product is an implementation of the Mastermind game, available online for free!
All the other products currently on the market, are not up to our design standards, so we decided to close this market gap of beautifully designed Mastermind games. 
We think, that this product is manageable for four people to develop in our time frame. 

### Business Goals ###

Our company is very optimistic, that we will make money from this through donations to the cause. We will find new users, to keep an eye out for the company's future projects. And it is good for our popularity within the Mastermind community.
Our business goals are fame within the Mastermind community and further beyond. We'd like to achieve a larger customer base.
